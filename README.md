Ka-Websocket
============

Ka Websocket is an annotation driven framework that allows developers to work with Server Side websocket code in a vendor neutral and productive way.  The goal is to provide support for all major Servlet Containers / Application Server once websocket support is introduced in these.  Support is also provided for all major dependency injection frameworks such as Spring, Guice and CDI.
